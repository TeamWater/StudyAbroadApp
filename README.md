# StudyAbroadApp
this cross platform app is for the WTAMU study abroad trip to Scandinavia.
It serves as a resourse point for our instructors to keep students up to date on events, times and locations.

We used the tool Appcelorator and followed Aaron Saunders book to learn and practive our mobile development skills.
